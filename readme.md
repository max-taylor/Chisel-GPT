# OpenAI

Expects an environment variable for:
`OPENAI_API_KEY=...`

# TODO

[ ] Pass error messages back to openai for command adjustment
Modify !help, to include my custom command (!chat)
Pass in the current environment as well
Replace the async_openai package with a package that allows you to set the seed, this will allow full deterministic responses
